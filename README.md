# RobustFingerprintAuthentication
Fingerprint authentication system with real time security alerts 
ABSTRACT 
This project focuses on secure fingerprint authentication integrated with Aadhaar for identity verification, complemented by real-time SMS notifications.
The primary goal is the immediate deletion of fingerprint data post-verification to maintain user privacy and security. Backend development leverages Python with
the Flask framework for robust web application logic and PostgreSQL for secure database management, ensuring encrypted storage of user data. 
Flask's file handling mechanisms manage the secure upload and temporary storage of fingerprint images.Upon user upload, the server securely stores the fingerprint image temporarily. Authentication involves verification against stored data or integration with Aadhaar APIs. Post-verification, the fingerprint 
image is promptly deleted to prevent unauthorized access and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.The Fingercode is stored encrypted in Postgre 
database  Users receive real-time SMS notifications via Twilio upon successful verification, including an OTP, timestamp, and purpose of access. This enhances 
user awareness and security, ensuring transparency in authentication processes. The project emphasizes HTTPS encryption for secure data transmission and strict 
access controls to protect sensitive information. Regular auditing of server logs and monitoring unauthorized access attempts fortify the system against 
threats. Compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR and CCPA is crucial for maintaining user trust. The seamless integration of biometric 
authentication with Aadhaar verification and real-time SMS notifications provides a secure and transparent authentication experience, with access beyond 
verification contingent on OTP confirmation.
