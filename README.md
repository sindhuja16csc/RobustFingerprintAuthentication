# RobustFingerprintAuthentication
Fingerprint authentication system with real time security alerts 
ABSTRACT 
The project titled "Robust Fingerprint Authentication with Real-Time Security Alerts" focuses on enhancing the security of fingerprint-based authentication by 
integrating it with Aadhaar for identity verification, augmented by real-time SMS notifications. The core objective is to implement a system where fingerprint 
data is immediately deleted after verification to uphold user privacy and security. The backend is developed using Python with the Flask framework, ensuring a 
robust web application logic. PostgreSQL is utilized for secure and encrypted storage of user data. The system incorporates secure fingerprint image handling, 
ensuring that uploaded images are temporarily stored and verified against stored data or Aadhaar APIs. Upon successful verification, fingerprint images are 
promptly erased to prevent unauthorized access and comply with data privacy regulations. Real-time SMS notifications are sent to users through Twilio containing 
an OTP, timestamp, and access details, increasing user awareness and transparency. The project employs HTTPS encryption for secure data transmission, enforces 
stringent access controls, and regularly audits server logs to prevent unauthorized access. Compliance with major data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA 
ensures that user trust is preserved. The integration of Aadhaar for identity verification with the addition of OTP verification and real-time SMS alerts 
provides a holistic, secure authentication experience.
